# System Design: GitHub (Repos, Git Storage, PRs, CI)

Scope: multi‑tenant git hosting, code browsing/search, pull requests, permissions, webhooks, CI runners.

## Git storage

- Sharded object storage for packfiles; replicas across AZs; maintenance (gc, repack) off the hot path.
- Smart HTTP/SSH; delta compression; quarantine on push; pre‑receive hooks for policy.

## Metadata and permissions

- Orgs/Teams/Repos/Branches/Tags; permissions matrix (admin/write/triage/read).
- Branch protection: required reviews, status checks; CODEOWNERS enforcement.

## Pull requests and code review

- PR model: base/head references; diff generation from git trees; comments stored in DB; draft reviews.
- Merge strategies: merge commit, squash, rebase; conflict detection; required checks gate merge.

## Search and code intel

- Indexer pipeline: parse repo events → fetch pack → index tokens/symbols to search backend (e.g., Zoekt/Elastic);
- Code navigation: LSIF uploads or on‑the‑fly language servers for hover/defs/refs.

## CI/CD (Actions)

- Workflow engine maps events (push/PR/schedule) to jobs; runners autoscale (K8s/VMs); sandboxing; cache/artifacts store.
- Secrets/vars with OIDC; concurrency groups and retry/backoff; matrix builds.

## Webhooks and integrations

- Event bus for repo/account events; delivery with retries/signatures; app marketplace.

## Reliability

- Read replicas for metadata; job isolation; abuse protection on runners; DDoS protection on git endpoints.

## APIs

```http
GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}
POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls
POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/workflows/{id}/dispatches
```

## Capacity & SLOs

- Repos: 100M; pushes peak 50k TPS; clones/reads peak 1M QPS; Actions jobs 500k/day.
- SLOs: Git fetch latency P95 < 200 ms (hot), PR load P95 < 300 ms, Actions start < 1 min P95.

## Consistency & integrity

- Git objects immutable; refs updates via transactional refs db; pre‑receive hooks enforce policies; background GC reconciles packs.

## Risks & mitigations

- Runner abuse/crypto‑mining → quotas, network egress limits, anomaly detection.
- Large monorepos → partial clones, sparse checkout, server‑side filtering.
